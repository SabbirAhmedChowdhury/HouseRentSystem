# HouseRentSystem
A digital solution to streamline house rent management

#Description

The proliferation of digital technologies has revolutionized various sectors, including real estate management. Traditional house rental management processes are often characterized by inefficiencies, manual record-keeping, and communication gaps between landlords and tenants. This research project presents the design and implementation of a comprehensive web-based House Rent Management System (HRMS) that addresses these challenges through modern software engineering practices.

The system is developed using a three-tier architecture comprising a React-based frontend, an ASP.NET Core Web API backend, and a SQL Server database. The solution provides distinct interfaces for three primary user roles: landlords, tenants, and administrators. Key functionalities include property listing and management, lease agreement generation and tracking, automated payment processing, maintenance request handling, and comprehensive reporting capabilities.

The implementation follows industry-standard design patterns including Repository Pattern, Unit of Work, Dependency Injection, and RESTful API principles. Security is ensured through JWT-based authentication, role-based authorization, and password hashing. The system incorporates automated background services for payment generation and reminder notifications, enhancing operational efficiency.

Extensive testing was conducted to validate system functionality, security, and performance. The results demonstrate that the system successfully automates rental management workflows, reduces administrative overhead, and improves communication between stakeholders. The solution provides a scalable foundation for future enhancements including mobile application support, advanced analytics, and integration with payment gateways.
